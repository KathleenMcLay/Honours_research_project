# Hi-C Library preparation, WGS DNA extraction and sequencing
Hi-C Libraries were prepared using the [Proximo Hi-C (Plant) Kit protocol v4.0](https://github.com/KathleenMcLay/Honours_research_project/blob/main/Laboratory/Proximo_Hi-C_Plant_Kit_Protocol_v4.0_20210208.pdf). 
Sequencing of Hi-C Libraries was completed by the Central Analytical Research Facility (CARF) at Queensland University of Technology (QUT).

DNA was extracted for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) using the [DNeasy Plant Pro Kit protocol](https://github.com/KathleenMcLay/Honours_research_project/blob/main/Laboratory/DNeasy%20Plant%20Pro%20Kit%20Protocol.pdf).
WGS Library preperation and sequencing was completed by the Central Analytical Research Facility (CARF) at Queensland University of Technology (QUT).
